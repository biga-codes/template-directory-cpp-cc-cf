/* You safely reach from point 0 to point a. Hence, you need at least (a - 0).
You safely reach from point a to point b. Hence, you need at least (b - a).
You safely reach point x. But notice that thereâ€™s no gas station at point x, so with the same fuel, you need to come back to point b again. Hence, we need at least 2 * (x - b) capacity.
Next, you need to reach point a from point b. This has a contribution of (b - a) which is already included in step 2.
Finally, you also need to reach point 0 from point a. This has a contribution of (a - 0), which is already counted in the first step.
Hence, minimum total capacity: max((a - 0), (b - a), 2(x - a)). */
// Link: https://codeforces.com/problem/B With n stations, the minimum total cost capacity is
//max((a[0] - 0), (a[1] - a[0]), ..., (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2]), 2(x - a[n - 1])) */
